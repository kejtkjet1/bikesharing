## Overview of Project

### Purpose

We processed a data of all the rides for CitiBike in New York for the month of August to invest in similar project in Des Moines. 

## Analysis

Before we bagan our analysis in Tableu we had to convert the data to a new dataframe to change data type to datetime.

Some of the key trends that we noticed around bike rentals
- Majority of the riders were Males
- Majority of the riders were subscribers
- The heavies traffic hours were early morning - and right after work- as well as day time on weekends. 

Here are some images illustrating the findings

## Summary

- To conduct more in depth analysis we should look at trends that are neighborhood specific and key in on the higher densiti rental locations to see if there are any variances to user type and to gender
- I also conducted an analysis included in the story - that looked at the most popular starting stations.
