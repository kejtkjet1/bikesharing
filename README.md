Looking at weekly trends by city type below, we can see that peak fares were the highest in urban and suburban areas third week of February, however in rural areas they were the highest at the beginning of April.

## Summary

- Urban areas should remain the main focus for the business, they are responsible for most volume and overall revenue. 
- A good way to expand the business opportunities will be initiatives to increase the volumes in rural areas where the fares per ride and per driver are much higher than the urban centers
- Similar recommendation for suburban areas, any initiative that increase the volumes of rides in this area will increase the profitability of the busienss.
